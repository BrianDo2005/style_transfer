# Style Transfer as Optimal Transport 

## This is a repository for an algorithm that transfers the distribution of visual characteristics, or style, of one image onto a second image via an [Optimal Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)) plan. It is implemented in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
